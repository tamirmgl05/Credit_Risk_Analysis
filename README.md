# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to predict credit risk by using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub which is a peer-to-peer lending services company. We will conduct the oversampling and undersampling strategies by using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and the ClusterCentroids algorithm techniques. Then, you’ll use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, you’ll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. 

The purpose of this analysis is well defined
