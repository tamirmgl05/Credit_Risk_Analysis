# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to predict credit risk by using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub which is a peer-to-peer lending services company. We will conduct the oversampling and undersampling strategies by using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and the ClusterCentroids algorithm techniques. Then, the combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm will take place. Finally, we will predict the credit risk by comparing two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.

## Results:
There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models (15 pt)

## Summary:
There is a summary of the results (2 pt)
There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification (3 pt)
